# Anti-Sedentary Service
The anti-sedentary service tells the heartsteps-server if a participant should receive an anti-sedentary message.

## Installation and runtime
To run the anti-sedentary service, the service-template image needs to be built first. The following commands will build the heartsteps_service-template and then run the anti-sedentary service.

``` bash
docker-compose build service-template
docker-compose run --service-ports anti-sedentary-service
```

## Production data
There is a need to pull and test data that is being generated by the production anti-sedentary service.

To copy production data from the google storage bucket to your local machine:
```bash
docker-compose run anti-sedentary-service copy-files
```
